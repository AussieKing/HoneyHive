          I came into this industry of interior design quite organically through
          my avid appreciation for art, history, architecture and my love for
          upcycling and breathing new life into new spaces and reinvigorating
          the old. My strength as a designer and stylist is my inherent ability
          to enhance interiors and create a healthy, balanced and aesthetically
          pleasing environment, whether it be a single room, an entire home, a
          hospitality venue, hotel, apartment complex or commercial dwelling. â€‹
          I am a bit of a nomad, being that I am Canadian but was born and
          raised in Indonesia. Living a somewhat transient lifestyle, the
          privilege of travel from an early age has enriched my creativity and
          allowed me to draw artistic inspiration from my cultural experiences.
